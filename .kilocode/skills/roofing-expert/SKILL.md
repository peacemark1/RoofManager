# Roofing Expert Skill

This skill provides domain knowledge and utility functions for roofing projects.

## Instructions
- Always prioritize safety and local building codes when suggesting materials.
- When calculating roofing squares, use the formula: `(Total Area / 100)`.
- Factor in a 10% waste margin for standard shingles and 15% for complex roofs with many ridges and valleys.
- Recommend asphalt shingles for residential projects and EPDM or TPO for flat commercial roofs.

## Tool Usage
- Use the `calculate_materials` tool to get a precise breakdown of bundles, underlayment, and nails needed based on roof area and pitch.
